# Project title:
Breast Cancer Diagnosis Rates and Socio-Demographic Factors

## Project Descriptions / Outline:  
Examine the occurrence of breast cancer diagnoses and mortality rates over a 5-year period while focusing on various socio-demographic factors (ethnicity, median household income, unemployment population/rate) and how these factors differ between the U.S. and Texas.

## Research Questions to Answer
1.  At the national level, what are the breast cancer incidences by race, income, and unemployment rate?
2.  At the national level, what are the cases of mortality by race, income, and unemployment rate?
3.  At the state level, what is the breast cancer incidence by race, income, and unemployment rate?
4.  At the state level, what are the cases of mortality by race, income, and by unemployment rate?


# Main conclusions:
*   Non-Hispanic White populations had a higher incidence & mortality rate compared to black & hispanic both nationally and in Texas.

*   A strong positive relation between median household income and breast cancer mortalities & incidences across the board for each ethnicity both nationally and in Texas.

*   The data shows as the unemployment rate increases the number of breast cancer incidences and cancer deaths decrease both Nationally and in Texas. We speculate this strong negative correlation could be due to less testing being performed due to economic budget constraints at the national level and fewer people going to the doctor due to lack of funds.
