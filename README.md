Project Descriptions / Outline:  
<<<<<<< HEAD
Examine the occurrence of breast cancer diagnoses and mortality rates over a 5-year period while focusing on various socio-demographic factors (ethnicity, median household income, unemployment population/rate) and how these factors differ between the U.S. and Texas.

Research Questions to Answer
1.  At the national level, what are the breast cancer incidences by race, income, and unemployment rate?
2.  At the national level, what are the cases of mortality by race, income, and unemployment rate?
3.  At the state level, what is the breast cancer incidence by race, income, and unemployment rate?
4.  At the state level, what are the cases of mortality by race, income, and by unemployment rate?

Research Questions to Answer
1.  Is there a higher rate of incidence/mortality based on ethnicity?
2.  Does median household income affect the incidence/mortality rate?
3.  If the unemployment rate is higher will there be a higher rate of incidence/mortality?
4.  How does Texas differ from the U.S. as a whole?
