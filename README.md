Breast Cancer Diagnosis Rates and Socio-Demographic Factors

Team Members:
Charles Quinn, Emily Boulware, Shelby Reyes-Widrick, Jackeline Larios

Project Descriptions / Outline:  
Examine the occurrence of breast cancer diagnoses and mortality rates over a 5-year period while focusing on various socio-demographic factors (ethnicity, median household income, unemployment rate) and how these factors differ between the U.S. and Texas.

Research Questions to Answer
1.  Is there a higher rate of incidence/mortality based on ethnicity?
2.  Does median household income affect the incidence/mortality rate?
3.  If the unemployment rate is higher will there be a higher rate of incidence/mortality?
4.  How does Texas differ from the U.S. as a whole?
